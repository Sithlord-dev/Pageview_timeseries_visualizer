# Pageview_timeseries_visualizer

For this project we visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots to understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth. We use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.
